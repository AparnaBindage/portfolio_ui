### Rumour Detection on twitter using Long Short Term Memory
Microblogging platforms like Twitter serves as an ideal place for fabricating and diffusing rumours. These rumours disseminate at a rapid pace and lead to grievous social issues. Rumours can cause social panic and adversely affect people and organizations. Therefore, detecting rumours accurately, quickly and automatically is important. Existing models detect rumours on social media sites by employing feature extraction which is time-consuming, biased and labour intensive. Even though,recent studies use machine learning-based methods for automatic rumour detection by extracting features of rumour contents (e.g., peopleâ€™s opinions, questions, etc.) and static spreading processes, early detection of rumour remains a challenge. The proposed system employs a deep learning model, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in collaboration with pooling function of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to quickly detect rumour. LSTM networks makes predictions based on time series data. It also overcomes problems faced while training traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), like, exploding and vanishing gradient. The dynamic changes of forwarding contents are taken into consideration using LSTM based model.
